                  <p>When you’re hidden in the dark for so long about your own family your thoughts race all over the place and you just don’t know how to react or what to do. Your whole mindset and thinking change. I always had a special bond with my aunt Rita but it was an aunt and niece relationship. I never thought in a million years that I would receive this news. Never ever have I thought that the only aunt that I had was actually my grandma. Not a day went by that I wasn’t with my aunt and she was like a second mother to me and now I see why. Anything I asked for I got and anywhere I wanted to go I went.  She was my best friend. Even though things probably wouldn’t have changed much our bond might have been stronger than just an aunt and niece relationship. I don’t regret knowing her as an aunt because she was a great one and the only one that I had. I just don’t like the fact that I was in the dark about my family connections. The whole time I was thinking this wasn’t my real family. The whole time I thought I was never going to find out who I really was.</p>
